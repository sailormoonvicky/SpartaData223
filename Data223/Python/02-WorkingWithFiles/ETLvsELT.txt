ETL vs. ELT
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) are data integration methods. Their main task is to transfer data from one place to another. However, each has unique characteristics and is suitable for different data needs. Their most important difference is that ETL transforms data before loading it on the server, while ELT transforms it afterward.

ETL is an older method ideal for complex transformations of smaller data sets. It’s also great for those prioritizing data security. On the other hand, ELT is a newer technology that provides more flexibility to analysts and is perfect for processing both structured and unstructured data.

Your decision between ETL and ELT will determine your data storage, analysis, and processing. So, before choosing between the two methods, it’s important to consider all factors. This includes the type of business you are running and your data needs.
